# EnglishCreativeProject2016
Upload (from Google Drive to GitHub) of my 10th grade English creative project that I used as an excuse to make a mini-game

First notable project using Swing and event handling
May or may not have used this Creative Project assignment as an excuse to write code
Project assignment was to creatively display the motif of Macbeth
Motif of Macbeth was how everybody has their demons and they eventually destroy them
No better way than to show this than an awful ASCII + ImageIcon game that makes your eyes bleed in which you have to make choices in picking up either Health boosts or Damage boosts... only thing is that boosting one will lower the other
